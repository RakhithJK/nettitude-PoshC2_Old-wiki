# Welcome to the PoshC2 wiki

PoSH C2 is a tool written completely in PowerShell, to aid penetration testers with the post exploitation process, the tools was developed off the back of our successful PowerShell payload addition for the MetaSploit Framework. PowerShell was chosen as the base language as it provides all of the functionality and rich features required, also there's no point re-inventing the wheel.
